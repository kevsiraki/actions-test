# actions-test

This repository is a demonstration of GitHub Actions setup for automated workflows. GitHub Actions enables you to automate various tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your code directly within your GitHub repository.

## Workflow Overview

This repository includes a simple workflow that triggers on push events to the main branch. The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code:** This step checks out your repository code, making it available for subsequent actions.

2. **Run Tests:** This step executes your test suite, ensuring that your code meets the specified quality and functionality standards.

3. **Build:** If applicable, this step performs any necessary build processes for your project.

4. **Deploy (Optional):** If your project involves deployment, this step can be configured to deploy your application to a specified environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub Actions in your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Create `.github/workflows` Directory:** In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory to store your workflow files.

2. **Define Workflow YAML File:** Create a YAML file within the `workflows` directory, defining your workflow steps, triggers, and any necessary configurations. You can use the provided `main.yml` file in this repository as a reference.

3. **Customize Workflow:** Tailor the workflow to fit the specific needs of your project. You can add or remove steps, adjust triggers, and configure environment variables.

4. **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes and push them to your main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow and start executing it based on the defined triggers.

## Example Workflow File

Here's a simplified example of a workflow file (`main.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI/CD Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          # Add your test commands here

      - name: Build
        run: |
          # Add your build commands here

      - name: Deploy
        if: success()
        run: |
          # Add your deployment commands here (optional)
